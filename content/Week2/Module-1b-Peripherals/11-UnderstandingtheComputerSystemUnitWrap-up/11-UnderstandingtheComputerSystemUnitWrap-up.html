<h2>Let's summarize</h2>
<p>This week we have looked at both the internal and external components of the computer system unit, the devices used for input of data and output of information, different means for storing data for future use, and the basic components of a simple home network.</p>

<h3>The System Unit</h3>
<p>The system unit houses the main <em class="bold">internal </em>electronic components of the system or device. These devices include (but are not an exhaustive list) the motherboard, processor, memory and adapter slots, which, in turn, hold the processor chip, memory modules, and adapter cards, internal drive bays, the hard drive and the power supply.</p>
<p>The system unit houses the main <em class="bold">external </em>components of the system unit. These devices include bays, slots, and ports.</p>
<p>The type of <em class="bold">computer user </em>will impact which type of system unit will support the user&rsquo;s requirements. User type would be classified home user, small business/home business user, mobile user, power user and enterprise user.</p>

<h3>Input, Output, and Storage</h3>
<p>The devices that are employed for entering data into the computer and the methods by which the information is presented to the user or stored for future use provide us with a list of peripherals that help to complete the system unit. Typical peripheral devices for input include a keyboard, mouse, scanner, digital,web or video camera, and microphone. Typical peripheral devices for output include the monitor, printer or plotter, and speakers. Peripherals that provide a means of storing information for future use include the internal hard drive, read/write disks (CD, DVD, Blu-ray), thumb drives, external hard drives, and cloud storage.</p>

<h3>Network Components</h3>
<p>To round out the picture of your computer system and all its components, we took a quick look at home networks &ndash; the required hardware, media for sending signals between computers, and some very basic home computer network setups.</p>
