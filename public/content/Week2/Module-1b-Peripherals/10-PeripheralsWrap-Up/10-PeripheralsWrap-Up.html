<h2><span title="Quick scroll up">Let&rsquo;s Summarize</span></h2>
<p>Peripherals are essential in making the system unit useful to us. They provide the means to input or store data as well as to present information to the user after that data is processed by the system unit. Typical peripheral devices for input include the keyboard, mouse, scanner, digital/web/video camera, and microphone. And typical peripheral devices for output include the monitor, printer or plotter, and speakers.</p>
<p>Information also needs to be stored for future use, and peripherals that support that function include internal hard drives, read/write disks (CD, DVD, Blu-ray), thumb drives, external hard drives, and cloud storage.</p>
<p>In choosing any of the peripherals here, it is important to evaluate your specific needs against the available options. In this module, we looked at factors to consider when choosing a keyboard, a monitor, and a printer, and when using cloud storage.</p>
<p>The final components are those that enable computers to communicate with each other. If you are connecting your computer to the internet, you need a modem. If you are connecting multiple computers to the internet via a modem, you will need a router to handle the sending and receiving of information from the internet or other computers. Networks can be wired using Ethernet cards and some form of cabling, or they can be wireless, requiring wireless adapters and, at a minimum, a wireless router.</p>
